## AZURE COSMOSDB

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed NoSQL database system that allows you to read and write data from the local replicas of your database and it transparently replicates the data to all the regions associated with your Cosmos account. With Azure Cosmos DB, you can add or remove the regions associated with your account at any time. Your application doesn't need to be paused or redeployed to add or remove a region.

- The Azure Cosmos DB account is the fundamental unit of global distribution and high availability.
- An Azure Cosmos DB container is the fundamental unit of scalability.
- A database is the unit of management for a set of Azure Cosmos DB containers.
- An Azure Cosmos DB container is the unit of scalability both for provisioned throughput and storage.

When working with containers, the cosmos API used can work with the container as a collection, table or graph. Consequently, the items in the container can be realized as documents, rows or nodes and edges.
